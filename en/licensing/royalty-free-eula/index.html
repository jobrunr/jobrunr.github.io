You are explicitly not allowed to redistribute the Software or Modifications as part of any product that can be described as a development toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder or any product that is intended for use by software, application, or website developers or designers.

IN ANY CASE, OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE.</p>
<h2 id="8-verification">8. VERIFICATION</h2>
<p>We or a certified auditor acting on Our behalf, may, upon its reasonable request and at its expense, audit You with respect to the use of the Software.

Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Your facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Your business activities. We shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that You are using the Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of the License Agreement, then You shall pay Our reasonable costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation, You agree to pay Us any amounts owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use. In the alternative, We reserve the right, at Our sole option, to terminate the licenses for the Software.</p>
<h2 id="9-third-party-software">9. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE</h2>
<p>The Software may contain third party open-source software which requires notices and/or additional terms and conditions.

<p>While redistributing the Software or Modifications thereof, You may choose to offer acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on Our behalf. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Us harmless from and against any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, Us (i) by reason of Your accepting any such support, warranty, indemnity or additional liability; or (ii) arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution of Your Application, except to the extent such claim is solely based on the inclusion of the Software therein.</p>
